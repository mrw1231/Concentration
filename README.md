# Concentration!

## History

Concentration, also known as Matching Pairs, Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pleonasm, Shank, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

Concentration can be played with any number of players or as a solitaire or patience game. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.

In my version, I have chosen to use dogs as my theme. The back of the cards are my actual dog, Wagner.

## Next Steps

This was my first time constructing a game. I mainly focused on its functionality. I plan to keep working and improve it's look and features.

I would like to focus more on the CSS and overall look and effects of the page.
